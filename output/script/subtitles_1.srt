00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,980
This is a random forest, a powerful machine learning algorithm based on decision trees,

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,690
and this is tennis, a sport I'm kind of obsessed with.

3
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:10,100
In this video, I'll build a random

4
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:15,000
forest, throw at it a bunch of tennis data, and then make it predict tennis much outcomes,

5
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,310
and predict the winner of a big tennis tournament.

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,240
And we'll see how it performs.

7
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,160
But first, I need data.

8
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,700
I want a lot of data.

9
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,240
I want every single breakpoint,

10
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,460
every single double serve, every single double fold, I want everything,

11
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:31,860
throw back hands, throw forehands, throw heights, throw ages, throw that name, throw mom's name,

12
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:34,410
throw grandma's secret lasagna recipe.

13
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,800
Yeah, I need that stuff too, man, I'm surviving on noodles

14
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,530
over here.

15
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:42,260
And then I found it, the holy grail of tennis data sets, a file so massive,

16
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:48,000
so detailed that opening it, crouched my computer, summoned three statisticians and made my axle

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,240
back for mercy.

18
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,480
The famous 2008 Wimmelon final between Rafa and Adal and Roger Featherer,

19
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,230
the longest grindstone final of all time, I got it.

20
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:59,980
Even this one time, this skidbit Rafa and Adal
